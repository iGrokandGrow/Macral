I created this little script to convert my journal entries made in Word to markdown files readable in Obsidian. 


I used python-docx for managing/opening Word files
I used Commonmark for markdown usable in Obsidian
I used Tkinter for the gui
I created a database in sqlite3. I thought I might need the database as a holding space during the conversion but I didn't. I'm leaving it in the program files in case it is needed as I expand this program.
